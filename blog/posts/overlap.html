</p><h1> The Problem of Overlapping Tags</h1><h4> September 28, 2018</h4><p>	Mexdown markup has the special property that text formatting can overlap.
For example, if you want text that has regions which are <em>italic, <u>italic and
underlined,</u></em><u> or just underlined</u>, you can simply write it as <code>*italic, _italic
and underlined,* or just underlined_</code> instead of redundantly opening and closing
the underline like <code>*italic, _italic and underlined,_*_ or just underlined_</code>.
You can imagine that text with multiple levels of nested formatting would
benefit from the clarity of overlapping markup.

	However, browsers do not like overlapping HTML and it is not considered
valid. Browsers can do some non-normative error recovery, as mentioned in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser">W3C standard</a>. In fact, they provide the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#adoption-agency-algorithm">adoption agency</a> algorithm, which I will mention later. Mexdown’s AST
encodes a paragraph’s formatting information as a list of structs, containing
beginning and ending offsets.
</p><pre>type Format struct {
	Kind FType
	Beg  int
	End  int
}
</pre><p>	Given that the Beg and End offsets from separate structs can overlap, how
does the code generator generate non-overlapping HTML? The adoption agency
algorithm mentioned earlier maintains a stack of formatting nodes, checking
specific error conditions along the way, and attempts to construct a tree with
the same semantics as the original markup. The closest comparison I can think of
is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm">Shunting-yard algorithm</a> but the adoption agency reattaches child
nodes to new parents, hence the name.

	Paragraphs in mexdown aren’t amenable to the same manipulation as a DOM that
is inherently a tree-like structure, at least not directly. We are given one
contiguous body of text, and a list of positions and their formatting
information.
</p><pre>// beginning and ending Formats are internally split into this structure.
type repl struct {
	i     int // position in text
	w     int // width of tag
	kind  int // e.g. &lt;em&gt;, &lt;/u&gt;, … 
	extra int
}
</pre><p>	Using a list of these tags, we would like to possibly manipulate them
in-place in a list instead of using a stack to construct a tree. With the
resultant list of tags, I can simply print them into a buffer, along with the
text between those positions.

	To demonstrate the algorithm I use in mexdown, I will simplify the problem
statement slightly without loss of generality. In HTML, <code>&lt;em&gt; this is &lt;u&gt;
overlapping &lt;/em&gt; text &lt;/u&gt;</code>, but we will represent this as <code>a b -a -b</code>. That
is, an opening tag is represented by a letter, and its respective closing tag is
the negation of the same letter. Our goal is to transform the HTML into <code>&lt;em&gt;
this is &lt;u&gt; overlapping &lt;/u&gt; &lt;/em&gt; &lt;u&gt; text &lt;/u&gt;</code>, which our solution represents
as <code>a b -b -a b -b</code>.

	Here is the algorithm written in Go, and a <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/aR8RHOhIC2S">playground link</a>:
</p><pre>package main

import (
	&#34;fmt&#34;
	&#34;strings&#34;
)

type tags struct {
	s []string
}

func from(s string) *tags {
	return &amp;tags{strings.Fields(s)}
}

func (t *tags) insert(i int, tag string) {
	t.s = append(t.s, &#34;&#34;)
	copy(t.s[i+1:], t.s[i:])
	t.s[i] = tag
}

func (t *tags) str() string {
	return strings.Join(t.s, &#34; &#34;)
}

func isOpenTag(tag string) bool {
	return tag[0] != &#39;-&#39;
}

func isRespectivePair(a, b string) bool {
	return a == b[1:]
}

func respectiveClosingTag(tag string) string {
	return &#34;-&#34; + tag
}

func main() {
	list := from(&#34;a b -a -b&#34;)
	bottom := 0
	for current := 0; current &lt; len(list.s); current++ {
		// Find closing tag
		if !isOpenTag(list.s[current]) {
			// Walk backwards through list
			for lower := current - 1; lower &gt;= bottom; lower-- {
				// Find first opening tag that does not match closing
				if isOpenTag(list.s[lower]) &amp;&amp; !isRespectivePair(list.s[lower], list.s[current]) {
					// Insert its closing tag before our unmatched tag
					list.insert(current, respectiveClosingTag(list.s[lower]))
					list.insert(current+2, list.s[lower])
				}
				current++
			}
			bottom = current + 1
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(list.str())
}

</pre><p>	Notice that the algorithm makes the greedy choice to close the unmatched tag
(insert at position i), and reopen it (insert at position i+2). It does this
repeatedly until the lower pointer it reaches the bottom index. This effectively
partitions the list into a non-overlapping and overlapping section, making it
easy to parallelize.

	Here's the execution pattern for a list of size 8:
